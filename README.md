# Point-cloud-processing
A suite of scripts and easy-to-follow tutorial to process point cloud data with Python, from scratch.
* [Point Cloud Basics](https://towardsdatascience.com/discover-3d-point-cloud-processing-with-python-6112d9ee38e7)

## Prerequisites

A computer with internet access, and (optionally), a Gmail and GDrive account to make it work out of the box.

## Installing

Nothing to install.

## Documentation
