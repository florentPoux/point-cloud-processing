# Point-cloud-processing
A suite of scripts and easy-to-follow tutorial to process point cloud data with Python, from scratch.

## Prerequisites

A computer with internet access, and (optionnally), a Gmail and GDrive account to make it work out of the box.

## Installing

Nothing to install.

## Documentation

Documentation of the various scripts can be found on the related articles: [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@florentpoux).
